<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pheromone Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sex Pheromones</li><li>Aggregation Pheromones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pheromone market features primarily two types: sex pheromones and aggregation pheromones. Sex pheromones attract opposite sex insects for mating, effectively disrupting pest reproduction and managing populations. In contrast, aggregation pheromones draw insects together, often for resource gathering, which can aid in pest monitoring and control strategies. Both types enhance integrated pest management, reducing reliance on chemical pesticides while promoting sustainable agriculture and crop protection practices by leveraging natural insect behaviors.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Agricultural Pheromone Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detection & Monitoring</li><li>Mass Trapping</li><li>Mating Disruption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pheromone market focuses on three key applications: detection and monitoring, mass trapping, and mating disruption. Detection and monitoring utilize pheromones to identify and assess pest populations, enabling timely interventions. Mass trapping employs pheromone lures to capture pests, reducing their numbers and mitigating crop damage. Mating disruption releases sex pheromones to confuse pests, preventing successful mating and population growth. Together, these strategies enhance effective pest management while minimizing chemical pesticide use, promoting sustainable agriculture.</p></p>
