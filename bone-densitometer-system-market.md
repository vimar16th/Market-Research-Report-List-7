<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometer System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Bone Densitometer</li><li>Peripheral Bone Densitometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone densitometer system market consists of two main types: axial and peripheral bone densitometers. Axial bone densitometers, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), primarily measure bone density in critical areas like the spine and hip, providing accurate assessments for osteoporosis. Peripheral bone densitometers evaluate bone density in peripheral sites like the wrist or heel, making them more portable and cost-effective for preliminary screenings. Both types serve essential roles in diagnosing and managing bone health conditions.</p></p>
