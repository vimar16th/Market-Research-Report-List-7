<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drag Reducing Agent for Oil Transportation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Viscosity Glue</li><li>Low Viscosity Glue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drag reducing agents (DRAs) are additives used in oil transportation to minimize frictional resistance in pipelines, enhancing flow efficiency. In the market, two main types are distinguished: high viscosity glue and low viscosity glue. High viscosity glue DRAs are thick and effective in significantly reducing turbulence in heavy crude oil, allowing for faster transport. Conversely, low viscosity glue DRAs are lighter, providing benefits in lower viscosity liquids, facilitating smoother flow and decreasing energy costs during pumping operations.</p></p>
