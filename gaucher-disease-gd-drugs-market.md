<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gaucher Disease (GD) Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enzyme Replacement Therapy</li><li>Substrate Reduction Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gaucher Disease (GD) drugs are primarily categorized into two main therapies: Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). ERT involves infusing patients with the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which is deficient in GD, to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. In contrast, SRT works by reducing the accumulation of substrates that cause cell damage, targeting the underlying metabolic issue. Both therapies aim to manage the symptoms of GD, enhancing patient outcomes and overall health.</p></p>
