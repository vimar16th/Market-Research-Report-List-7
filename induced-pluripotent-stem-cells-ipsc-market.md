<p><p>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are a type of stem cell derived from adult somatic cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state. This reprogramming allows iPSCs to differentiate into any cell type in the body, making them a powerful tool for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug discovery, and personalized therapies. Unlike embryonic stem cells, iPSCs avoid ethical concerns as they are not derived from embryos.</p><p>The iPSC market is experiencing significant growth, driven by advancements in stem cell research, increasing demand for regenerative medicine, and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% during the forecast period. Key factors contributing to this growth include technological innovations in reprogramming techniques, expanding applications in drug development, and growing investments in stem cell research.</p><p>Recent trends in the iPSC market include the development of 3D bioprinting technologies for tissue engineering, the use of iPSCs in creating organoids for disease modeling, and the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance cell differentiation processes. Additionally, collaborations between academic institutions, biotech companies, and pharmaceutical firms are accelerating the commercialization of iPSC-based therapies. The market is also witnessing increased regulatory support and funding for stem cell research, further propelling its expansion.</p></p>
