<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spring Return Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Electric"</li><li>"Pneumatic"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spring Return Actuator market consists mainly of two types: Electric and Pneumatic actuators. Electric spring return actuators utilize electrical power to drive the actuator and rely on a spring mechanism to return to a default position when de-energized, offering precise control and easy integration with automated systems. Pneumatic spring return actuators, on the other hand, use compressed air for movement and spring force for retraction. They are typically preferred in applications requiring rapid response and higher force output.</p></p>
