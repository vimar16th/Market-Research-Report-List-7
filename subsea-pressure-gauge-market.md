<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subsea Pressure Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compensated Model</li><li>Not Compensated Model</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The subsea pressure gauge market is primarily divided into two types: compensated and not compensated models. Compensated models are designed to adjust for variations in hydrostatic pressure, providing accurate readings under different depths. These gauges typically include mechanisms that counteract pressure changes, ensuring reliability in extreme environments. In contrast, not compensated models do not adjust for such variations, making them simpler but potentially less accurate at varying depths. Both models serve distinct applications in subsea operations, depending on accuracy needs and environmental conditions.</p></p>
